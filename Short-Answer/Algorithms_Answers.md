#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) `O(n)` - There's one while loop and it's multiplying `n` a few times, but time complexity is always going to rely on size of `n`. Therefore I'm reading it as O(n).


b) `O(n^2)` - There first `forLoop` depends on the size of `n` which would be `O(n)`. All operations inside loops are `O(1)`. The second `forLoop` is dependent on `n` as well. The nested loops would be dominant over the `O(1)` operations inside the loops.


c) `O(n)` - The time depends on the number of `bunnies (n)` being passed in. Then it's essentially looping by recursion `n` times until it reaches its base case.
